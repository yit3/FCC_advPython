# the abs() function

"""
abs(x, /)
    Return the absolute value of the argument.
"""

#In mathematics, the absolute value or modulus of a real number x, denoted |x|,
# is the non-negative value of x without regard to its sign. Namely,
# |x| = x if x is positive, and |x| = −x if x is negative, and |0| = 0.
# For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of −3 is also 3.

#show the absolute number

print(abs(-3))
#turn -3 in to positive number 3

# dir(__builtins__) that would include the builtin-constant, builtin-exceptions, and builtin-functions
print(dir(__builtins__))

#check out all the function use in the abs function
print(dir(abs))

#or use help to check the description of that function in their help file.
print(help(abs))
