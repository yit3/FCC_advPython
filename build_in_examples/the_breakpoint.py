# breakpoint(*args, **kws)
# This function drops you into the debugger at the call site. Specifically, it calls sys.breakpointhook(),
# passing args and kws straight through. By default, sys.breakpointhook() calls pdb.set_trace() expecting no arguments.
# In this case, it is purely a convenience function
# so you donâ€™t have to explicitly import pdb or type as much code to enter the debugger.
# However, sys.breakpointhook() can be set to some other function and breakpoint() will automatically call that,
# allowing you to drop into the debugger of choice.

#while in PDB; Q to quit, C to continue...

    breakpoint(*args, **kws)

    Call sys.breakpointhook(*args, **kws).  sys.breakpointhook() must accept
    whatever arguments are passed.

    By default, this drops you into the pdb debugger.
